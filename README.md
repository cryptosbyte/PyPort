# PyPort üê£
Classic Simple Python IDE

PyPort is a simple IDE, made in C#, using Microsoft Visual Studio and additional libraries (such as Guna as the main Window library, and other NuGet packages). There are some bugs here and there, so issues and pulll requests are further appreciated.

Please do note that this isn't at it's final deployment/release; there are some issues that need fixing by the community. One of the issues is the `ConsoleControl`; this is on line 39 on `Python.cs`.
